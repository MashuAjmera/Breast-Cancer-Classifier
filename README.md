# Data Mining
A project where we preprocess the dataset and perform classification, clustering and association rule mining.

## [Comparing Classifiers for Balance scale Dataset](https://github.com/MashuAjmera/Data-Mining/blob/master/Comparing%20Classifiers%20for%20Balance%20scale%20Dataset.ipynb)
Classification for discrete data. The dataset used here is [Balance scale weight and distance](https://www.kaggle.com/mysticvalley/balance-scale).

## [Comparing Classifiers for Rice Dataset](https://github.com/MashuAjmera/Data-Mining/blob/master/Comparing%20Classifiers%20for%20Rice%20Dataset.ipynb)
Classification for continuous data. The dataset used here is [Rice Seed Dataset (Gonen&Jasmine)](https://www.kaggle.com/seymasa/rice-dataset-gonenjasmine).

## [Comparing Clustering Methods for Online Retail Customer Dataset](https://github.com/MashuAjmera/Data-Mining/blob/master/Comparing%20Clustering%20Methods%20for%20Online%20Retail%20Customer%20Dataset.ipynb)
Clustering. The dataset used here is [Online Retail Customer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hellbuoy/online-retail-customer-clustering).

## [Analyzing Market Basket Dataset](https://github.com/MashuAjmera/Data-Mining/blob/master/Analyzing%20Market%20Basket%20Dataset.ipynb)
Association Rule Mining. The dataset used here is [Groceries Market Basket Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/irfanasrullah/groceries).

## [Breast Cancer Classifier](https://github.com/MashuAjmera/Data-Mining/blob/master/Breast_Cancer_Classifier.ipynb)
The dataset used here is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). This dataset contains 569 records of and 32 features (including the Id). The features represent various parameters that might be useful in predicting if a tumor is malignant or benign.
